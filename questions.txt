Section 5.6 The do-while Loop
#
4.	How many times will the following code print "Welcome to Java"?

int count = 0;
do {
  System.out.println("Welcome to Java");
  count++;
} while (count < 10);
a.	8
b.	9
c.	10
d.	11
e.      0
KEY:c The count is initialized to 0 before the loop. The loop is executed 10 times for count from 0 to 9. When count is 10, the loop continuation condition becomes false. The loop is finished. So, the correct answer is C.
